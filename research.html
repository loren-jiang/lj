        	<p align="left"> The <a href = "https://www.michaelyartsev.com/" target = "_blank" >Neurobat Lab </a> conducts research to understand the neural basis of complx spatial and communicative behaviors in mammals using on the echolocting bat - one of the most spatially and acoustically sophisticated mammamls. As an undergraduate researcher, I collaborate with graduate faculty to analyze bat communication, using Matlab programs and other software to segment and cluster audio and neural data based on key signal features. I have analyzed acoustic data from two independent bat colonies of the same species to compare their temporal and spectral features as well as written Matlab scripts to help process the data. In addition, I have designed and manufactured tools and parts necessary for graduate researcher experiments via 3D modeling and prototyping and the <a href="http://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank"> Jacobs Institute </a> makerspaces at UC Berkeley. These include custom experimental cages, surgical implants, and optical tools. For my current project, I am working to mitigate the effect of noise in the process of spike sorting - a class of techniques used to isolate the action potentials of neurons in electrophysiological data.   </p>

        	<p align="left"> Heart valves play a crucial role in controlling unidirectional blood flow for heartbeats. The aortic valve is especially important considering that it is the last valve before oxygen-rich blood reaches the body. Aortic valves are normally tricuspid with three, roughly symmetrical leaflets. However, about 1% of the population is born with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and about 0.1% with a quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV). BAV and QAV patients often experience higher rates of heart valve disease and other associated complications. This raises the question on the effect number of leaflets affects valve on performance. Traditional mechanical or bio-prosthetic valve replacements are bicuspid or tricuspid, but perhaps exploring quadricuspid geometries may be valuable. This research hopes to explore how varying the number of leaflets affects the stress-strain distributions of aortic heart valves under diastole, with hopes of introducing new options and suggestions for improving aortic valve replacements.

and Germination </strong> 
        	<p align="left"> As part of my extended essay of the high school International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, I conducted research on the effects of aluminum toxicity at varying pH levels on plant growth  - specifically, growth and germination rate. My experiments were done on romaine lettuce seeds over a 20 day period and measurements on growth and germination were recorded daily. Overall, it was shown that the addition of aluminum into the nutrient solution caused and adverse effect on both germination and growth, and those effects worsened as the pH decreased.
