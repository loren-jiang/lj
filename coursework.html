        	<p align="left"> The class project is to design a racing robot which can follow a curving and self-crossing racetrack at speeds greater than 3 meters per second using an optical sensor. Each team starts with a standard 1/10th-scale RC car platform and a pre-built CPU board, determines an optimal strategy, and designs sensors, electronics, and control algorithms. Vehicles individually follow a 100 meter course, staying on track and avoiding obstacles. </p>

        	<p align="left"> Using the Baxter robot from Rethink Robotics, this project involved designing a system to recognize a number unique objects on the workspace and move them to their desired positions with relatively low rates of failure. For the object recognition and localization, we chose to use deep learning for the object detection and localization. Convolutional neural network performs very well at computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection. Additionally, there are many state-of-the-art developed algorithms with open source code for us to implement. Therefore, we chose Faster R-CNN, one of the state-of-art detection algorithm in this field which depends on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations.To implement the robotic manipulation and grasping, we used the Baxter robot from Rethink Robotics. Baxter has two arms, each with 7 degrees of freedom. The left arm was used to visualize our workspace with a built-in camera, and the right arm was equipped with a gripper to grasp and move our objects. Our workspace consisted of colored wooden blocks on a table with a white backdrop. For more details on the project, please visit <a href="https://ors0.weebly.com/" target="_blank"> here.</a> </p>

        	<p align="left"> BearMaps is interactive web-mapping application for the greater Berkeley area. Along with my partner Jonathan Li, we focused on the backend - implementing core functionality using freely available mapping data. Specifically, we used tile images and map feature data from the OpenStreetMap project to develop a rastered map, a routing feature based on the A* search algorithm, and a search bar feature with autocomplete. Credits go to Alan Yao, our CS 61B instructor, for creating the project specifications. View GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/loren-jiang/bear_maps.git" target="_blank"> here.</a> </p>

        	<p align="left"> This project was focused on two concepts taught in this course: closed-loop feedback and PCA (principal component analysis) classification. We used PCA to pick a set of four distinct words that would correspond to the car turning left, turning right, going forward quickly, and going forward slowly. Using a small microphone and TI-MSP430 microcontroller, voice commands were picked up, processed, and assigned to the closest word (k-means clustering). The car then performed the subsequent movement. Closed-loop feedback was implemented to ensure that when told to go forward, both the left and right wheel would have the same angular velocity ensuring a straight trajectory.

          <p align="left"> The objective of this lab is to achieve simultaneous control of both the angular position of the pendulum and horizontal position of the cart on the track using full-state feedback. We considered small angle perturbations and sine wave reference tracking of the cart position. Note that the system is a SIMO (Single Input Multiple Output) system, since we are trying to control both the position of the cart and the angle of the pendulum by using only the motor voltage. A Luenberger observer was subsequently added that enables state estimation of the inverted pendulum, given the position of the cart and pendulum. The estimates will be used as a form of feedback control. Further modification included a Linear Quadratic Regulator, and to understand the effects of the penalty matrices P and Q on the performance of the closed loop system.

          <p align="left"> The goal of this lab was to design and implement an analog controller for the magnetic leviation system. A precise amount of current would be run through a coil to levitate a ferrous ball underneath, achieved through closed-loop feedback. The sensor system implemented a photoresistor to measure the amount of light received in the presence of the ball when an LED was turned on. When the ball went slightly upward or downward more light would hit the sensor, and thus a reference voltage could be established. The system was linearized about small displacements in height of the ball, and appropriate transfer functions were derived. The system was first simulated in MATLAB using Simulink and then physically realized. An output offset circuitry, analog controller, and current offset circuity were implemented to achieve stabilization of the system. The result was a ball that could levitate magnetically, but was not very robust to larger disturbances.

        <p align="left"> <strong> Electrical Engineering 120: Video Magnification </strong> 
        	<p align="left"> This iPython Notebook module implements the idea of video magnification. Subtle changes naked to unassisted eye in video are extracted using a bandpass filter, amplified in magnitude, and then added back on top of the original video. In the 1-D case, the frequency of small translational movements can be filtered out. In the case of 2-D color images, the frequency of changes in both translational movement and color can be extracted using the same 1-D principle for each color channel encoding red, green, or blue. These concepts allow us to amplify very small changes in what appears to be still video. Real world applications include visualizing a person's pulse or breathing patterns.

        	<p align="left"> ​The objective of our project was two­fold. We wanted to create a small model of a wind turbine which consisted of turbine blades that would generate the most power and a tower structure that would have the maximum stiffness­to­weight ratio. Under the conditions of a wind speed of 25 mph and using a 6 VDC motor (80 mA, 8500 rpm), we wanted to design turbine blades that rotate the motor shaft of the motor in order to produce the most power. Stiffness was found by applying a normal force to the top of the structure and then measuring its displacement. The goal was to make a tower structure that had the least deflection and the smallest volume. Read the full project report <a href="coursework/E26_project_report.pdf" target="_blank"> here. </a></p>
